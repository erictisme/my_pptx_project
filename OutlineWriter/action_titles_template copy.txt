TITLE: "Overview of revenue components and forecast approach"

CONTENT:
• Fare and toll revenue
– Applied different scenarios of how long the current state of social distancing will last based on actuals, and what ridership/mobility ramp-up might look like after that. For those scenarios, considered the impact of epidemiology, policy effects, and behavioral changes
– Ridership/traffic curves

• Non-fare revenue
– Identified five archetypes of tax or subsidy revenue – Employment, Real Estate and Mortgages, Sales, Business Income, and Mobility – each with a distinct driver. Created a multiplier for each archetype, which was applied to each source to forecast 2020 revenue
– Tax-specific change profiles

LAYOUT: Standard title + content
TITLE: "Guiding questions for fare methodology"

CONTENT:
• Although different assets may behave differently, e.g., commuter rail may have a slower ramp-up than bus given that commuter rail riders could be more likely to work from home for longer or to use a personal vehicle, some early sensitivity testing was conducted and showed that additional precision from a bottom-up build did not meaningfully impact the aggregate number

• Guiding questions → Resulting actions for methodology

– What level of ridership are we going to, i.e., what's the 'new normal' level in a period of economic decline/social distancing?
• Looked at historical experience for what "new normal" looks like in an economic crisis. Began with ridership and toll recovery from the trough during the Great Recession, then took an additional haircut to reflect a number of factors that could continue to suppress demand (e.g., increased prevalence of work from home)

– What will the ramp up be like to get from point 1 to point 2, and when will it start?
• Looked at ramp-up curves in health/safety/security crises (e.g., 9/11, SARS) as well as economic crises (e.g., Great Recession) to understand how demand has reacted to past crises, and shaped a potential curve for a dual health/safety and economic crisis

– How will this ramp up be interrupted by a potential resurgence of the virus in Q4 2020?
• Modeled two scenarios of potential interruption by a resurgence, one where a second wave would result in something similar to present-day physical distancing conditions (in addition to seasonal flu), and a second more positive scenario factoring in the impact of better preparedness which would reduce the trough as currently experienced

– What is current ridership during intense social distancing (e.g., the current period)?
• Used actuals provided by the MTA and compared across systems to calibrate. Ridership for most systems is down dramatically (~90%).

• Current as of 4/28/20

TITLE: "How COVID-19 may be different than past health or safety shocks
Considerations for modeling a COVID-19 curve"

CONTENT:
• Current as of 4/28/20
• Four bullet considerations for the length of the crisis and potential resurgence:
– This does not appear to be a point in time crisis like 9/11 but an extended multi-month and possibly multi-year event until the virus is contained and therapeutics and vaccines are developed.
– As of this date, it is widely expected by public health officials that as social isolation measures are lifted, infection rates will increase.
– It is unclear what the impact of seasonality, if any, may be on the coronavirus spread.
– Depending on multiple factors including herd immunity, human behaviors, hospital capacity readiness, and policies in the fall, a second major wave could be experienced, potentially coinciding with peak flu season.

CONTENT:
• Graph is described as potential scenarios for ridership through the end of 2020, showing % of base level ridership on the y-axis and months (Jan–Dec) on the x-axis. Two lines:
– Scenario 1: Earlier containment and recovery
– Scenario 2: Delayed containment and recovery
• Ridership is shown dropping dramatically, with partial recovery and potential resurgence.
• Annualized fare-based revenue impact:
– Scenario 1: ~ -60%
– Scenario 2: ~ -75%

• Key bullet points:
– The scenarios combine characteristics of health and economic crises.
– Major assumptions underlying the difference in scenarios:
• Ramp-up after lockdown: Scenario 2 features a relatively slower change from current ridership levels, factoring in more countervailing forces (e.g., personal preferences away from transit, increased WFH).
• Resurgence in the fall: both scenarios include a potential second wave, but Scenario 2’s resurgence is more dire.

• Note: (4/28/20) Standard Disclaimer (previously noted).
